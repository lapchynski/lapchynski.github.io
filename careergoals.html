        <h1>Career Goals</h1>

        <p class="flow-text">Currently, I'm looking for an internship or co-op related to systems administration,
          cybersecurity, or software development utilizing strong collaborative abilities and problem-solving
          skills as well as extensive programming experience, ideally in the Columbus area. I have significant
          experience with Linux and Linux administration and security, as well as bash, Python, and C programming,
          and an internship or co-op using these or related skills would be ideal. After I graduate, I'd like a full-time
          position utilizing a similar skillset in a collaborative environment.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">I am in my third year of completing a B.S. in Computer Science and
          Engineering (CSE) and my second year of a B.S. in Mathematics, both at The Ohio State University.
          I expect to graduate with these in Spring 2021 and Autumn 2021, respectively, and my GPA is 3.8/4.0
          for the computer science degree and 3.9/4.0 for the math degree.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">I have held multiple positions that are relevant to my degrees, including as a
          Student Systems Administrator and as a math tutor. The Student Systems Administrator position is at
          the Computer Science and Engineering Department at OSU, and at this position, I work with the full-time
          system administrators for the CSE department and the College of Engineering to both maintain existing
          computing infrastructure and setup new equipment and establish new procedures. I work with Linux on a
          daily basis, as well as bash and Python scripting (and a few other languages) in both an environment of
          office desktops and of research and production servers. In total, I manage or help manage an environment
          of around 350 Linux servers and desktops. As a math tutor, I help other students to understand math
          concepts and ideas by walking them through example problems and explaining concepts in different ways,
          adjusting explainations to each student and their level of understanding. This requires strong interpersonal
          skills and communication ability, especially being able to communicate effectively with someone without the
          same level of knowledge and understanding of certain topics. These are expanded on further in the résumé page.</p>
